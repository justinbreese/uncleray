I began working with clay years ago in school but lifeâ€™s journeys interrupted that connection until I started working for Syracuse University about 20 years ago when I decided to re-explore ceramics.  When I first worked with clay it was as a sculpture, when I came back to clay I began making functional work. Throwing bowls on the wheel is incredibly comforting to me; it takes me to a very special place.

My influences are the people around me who mentor and inspire me, students, professors and fellow artists alike.  The collaborative culture we find in a studio environment like we have at Syracuse University is immeasurable.
