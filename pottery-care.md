I hope you enjoy your pottery as much as I enjoyed making it for you.

Stoneware is very durable but precautions should be taken.

All of my pottery is dishwasher and microwave safe. To use a pot in the oven, it is best to place a room-temperature piece in a cold oven. Please do not expose the pottery to extreme temperature changes (cold fridge or freezer to hot oven).
